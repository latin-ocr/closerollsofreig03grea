CHRONICA MAGISTRI ROGERI DE HOUEDENE. Vols. L-IV. Edited
by the Rev. WILLIAM STURBS, M.A., Regius Professor of Modern
History and Fellow of Orio] Collega. Oxford. 1868-1871.

The earlier portion, extending from 732 to 1148, appears to be a copy of a compilation
made in Nerthumbria about 1161, to which Hoveden added little. From 1148 to 1169—a very
valuable portion of this work—the matter is derived fsom another source, to which Hoveden
appears to have supplied little. From 1170 to 1192 is the portion which corresponds to some
extent with the Chronicle known under the name of Benedict of Peterborough (see No. 49),
From 1192 to 1201 may be qaid to be wholly Hoveden's worn.
