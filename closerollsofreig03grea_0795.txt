This work forms a comprehensive Palaeographic Series for
[rela-nd. It furnishes characteristic specilnens of the documents
which have come down from each of the classes which, in past
ages, formed principal eIements in the population of Ireland, or
exercised an influence in her affairs. With these reprodnctions
are combined fac-similes of Writings connected with eminent per-
sonages or transactions of iniportance in the annals of the country
to the carly part of the eighteenth century.

The specimens have been reproduced as nearly as possible in
accordance with the originale, in dimensione,colouring. and general
appearance. Characteristic examples of styies of writing and cali-
graphio ornamentation are. as far as practicable, associated with
subjects of historic and lingu'ffitic interest. Descriptions of the
various manuscripts are given by the Editor in the Introduction.
The. contente Os the specimens are sully elucidated and printed in
the original languages, opposite to the Fac—sinisses——line sor line—
without contractions—thus facilitating reference and aiding effec-
tively those interested ln palaeographie studies.

In the work are also printed in full, for the first time. many
originaI and important historic-al documents.

Part Ι. commences with the earliest Irish MSS. extant.
